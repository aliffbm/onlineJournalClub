	Notes April 13, 2017

	# Note All Neurons show Action Potentials

		- Graded Potentials
			- This is not an all or nothing system. 
			- The amount of neuro-transmitters released 
			depend on the amount of stimulus coming in i.e.
			celia in the ear receiving sound stimulus.

	# Communication Between Cells
		- Synapse
			- An event where one neuron releases neurotransmitter
			and another (post synaptic cell) neuron receives the
			 neurotransmitter information
		- Synaptic Cleff
			- An area between to neurons where neurotransmitters are
			released. 
			- The area between the presynaptic cell and the
			postsynaptic cell.

		- Neurotransmitter
			- The (synaptic) Vesicle
				- Made of double lipid membrane that holds the
				neurotransmitter
				- Attach themselves to a fusion pore
			- After neurotransmitter released into cleft
				- The vesicles returns to beginning process of
				system and collects more neurotransmitters

		- Neuron Membrane
			- Ion Gates
			- Fusion Pore
			- Other binding receptors
				- Typically at the dendrite
		- The Synapes
			- Excitatory Post Synaptic Potentail
				- Once NT binds to receptor sites, it opens
				an ion channel. At that point, ions begin to flow
				- enzymes are available to help catalyze the 
				process
				- Adding popsitively charged Na+ decreases polarity 
				of post-synaptic cell, bringing it closer to its threshold
				for firing = Excitation
					- EPSP = Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential


			- Inhibitory Post Synaptic Potential
				- <\Write More>
		- There could many more than one neuron communicating to
		any one cell
			- The cell can fire from a summation of input from 
			neurotransmitter received from multiple/different cells

			- Ionotrophic Sysnaps
				- Where NT binds to receptor and ions can flow in
				- Rapid Response
				- Very Short Lived
				- For sending message along a pathway quickly
					- i.e. touching fire, stepping on stone, etc. 


			- Metabotrophic Synapse
				- Not a rapid (slow) Response
				- 5HT (seratonin)
				- Long Lasting
				- For setting conditions - mood, attention, etc. 
				- Ribosomes are used in the post synaptic cell
				- When the seratonin binds to receptor site, 
				ions DON'T open, instead it changes the configuration
				inside the Post Synaptic Cell and a G protein
				is released. Once G protein is released, it then 
				triggers production of "Second Messengers" which 
				bind to the G protein fragment. 
					- This final G protein fragment combined with
					the "Second Messengers", it then binds to site
					and create an open ion channel. 

		# Let's talk about a few specific Neurotransmitters! 

			- Acetylcholine (Ach)
				@functions: All neuro-muscular junctions;
				Cortical arousal - at the forebrain to help
				wake up in the morning. Most of the time 
				this NT is excitatory. 

			- GABA
				@functions: Suppress cortical activity; Regulate
				anxiety. This NT is inhibitory and helps to allow people to sleep at night. People with 
				insufficient GABA may express symptoms of 
				anxiety

			- Glutamate
				@functions: Most common +; learning, Perception, 

			- Serotonin (5HT)
				@functions: Often a neuromodulator; Mood, Sleep,
				perceptual processes, etc. 
			- Dopamine
				@functions: Reinforment (Pleasure) center; Attention; Motor Controls

			- Norepinshrpine 
				@function: Arousal; Attention
				- is endogenous
			- Epinephrine (Adrenalin) 
				@function: Arousal; Attenion
				- is endogenous 
			- Substance P
				@function: Pain (damage, itch, extreme temp, etc.)
			- Endorphins
				@functions: Counter effect of Substance P; Pain
				killer
			- Hormones
				@function: Testosterone, Estrogen, Oxytocin, 
				Insulin

		# Agonist vs. Antagonist
			- Agonist
				- Increases the lifelihood of a NT having its 
				effect
				- Acetylcholine Antagonist - AcetylCholine Esterase
			- Antagonist
				- Decreases the likelihood of a NT having its effect
				- Acetylcholine Antagonist - Blocks the AChe



		# Other things that affect Sypanse System
			- Dendritization - Increase # of dendritic spines  

			&bull; Kinesin Molecules
				&spades; Transporting NT to terminal
				- All axons have microtubles where the Kinesin travels the 
				vesicles on. 
				- These are two protein strands thought wind itself around 
				each other

			- Auto-Receptor????
